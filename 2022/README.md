# About
This is my participation in the AoC 2022. I wish to learn Go starting from 0 with it but I might use my old C++ friend if the learning part takes too much time.

# Prerequiste
- Go 1.18+

# How to use

To execute:
```bash
go run main.go -part 1
go run main.go -part 2
```

To test the example input: 
```bash
go test
```

To benchmark
```bash
go test -bench=.
# You can define the running time of the benchmark with
go test -bench=. -benchtime=5s
```
